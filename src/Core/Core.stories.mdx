# Core features

Most of the basic components available in `veto-ui` are augmented with the `sx` props. This is a concept that comes
directly from [rebass](https://rebassjs.org/). The main difference between that library and this one is that we're
using proper typescript typing under the hood, but functionally, it's the same.

The `sx` props is a powerful tool to dynamically inject styles at runtime. It's also directly linked into the theming
system. What this means is you can expect consistant colors, spacings and such.

We've provided a few basic components with no stylings attached to them so you can edit them at will to remix new
components.

## Box

The box component is an augmented div with the `sx` props. By default, no styles are applied to it.

<Preview>
  <Story name="basic">
    <Box>This is a box</Box>
  </Story>
</Preview>

To customize it, you can simply add your css definition object into the `sx` props.
Any valid css (and this includes pseudo classes and targeting classes directly) is supported.

<Preview>
  <Story name="box with sx">
    <Box
      sx={{
        bg: 'papayawhip',
        color: 'hotpink',
      }}
    >
      This is a box
    </Box>
  </Story>
</Preview>

Additionally, since `sx` is connected directly to the root theme object, you can use theme values directly!
By default, the property and values you access depends on the key being used in your css definition object.

For example, if we use the `p` property (shorthand for `padding`), you can write `p: 2` to access the second
scale of the spacing property contained within the theme object.

<Preview>
  <Story name="box with theme values">
    <Box
      sx={{
        bg: 'papayawhip',
        color: 'hotpink',
        p: 2,
      }}
    >
      This is a box
    </Box>
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Props of={Box} />

## Flex

Same API as the `<Box />` component. The main difference is that it's has `display: flex` already set.

## Grid

Same API as the `<Box />` component. The main difference is that it's has `display: grid` already set.
